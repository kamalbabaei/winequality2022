This project was done using PLSRGLM method to predict scores of different types of wine accordding to the previously scored dataset.
PLSRGLM (Partial Linear Squares Regression for Generalized Linear Models) is a method that has several similarities to PCA, with the difference that PCA focuses solely on the data matrix trying to summorise the information in that matrix. However, PLSRGLM finds the direction within the data matrix which is not only a good summary for the data, but also the direction that has the best reltionship with the Y response(s).
